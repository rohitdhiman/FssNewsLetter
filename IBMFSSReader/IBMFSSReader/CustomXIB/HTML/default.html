                Dear Colleagues<br><br>
                I am really excited to connect with each one of you and I take this opportunity to thank you for your continued dedication, commitment and resilience that you have shown in serving our customers.</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;The current year will be a year of transformation both within the IT Industry and specifically with regard to our organization. As many of you are aware that IBM has made significant investments and will continue to do so in the areas of Cloud, Analytics, Mobile, Social and Security (CAMSS) and this will also significantly impact the way we address the needs of our customers within the Financial Services Sector. As professionals, we need to embrace this change and transform ourselves in this new era to serve our clients in a more effective and agile manner and be essential to the needs of our customers.</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The new age of doing business will inevitably lead to a refocus and realignment of our offerings in the banking and insurance space in the areas of transformation, risk, customer experience, cost optimization, data, analytics, etc. and I urge upon each of you to play a crucial role in this transformational journey both from our customers perspective and from the perspective of your individual development.&nbsp; As practitioners, you are closest to the needs of our customers and the need of the hour is to be individually be accountable for this transformation, start learning and start acting with agility.</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The new era is also an age for collaboration. The success of our sector and IBM will depend on how effectively we collaborate within our organization, our vendors, our partners, our customers and all our associated stakeholders and thereby driving value both to our customers and IBM.&nbsp; I would therefore request you engage in this eco system and drive profitable growth within your existing portfolios and accounts and also to effectively collaborate with our Go to Markets teams to help sell more for IBM.</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Three keys asks I have to each of you are:</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: justify;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand your skills in CAMSS area and help define business problems that we can solve for your customers</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: justify;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Build Agile delivery skills, and</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: justify;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seize opportunities to innovate in everything you do and contribute to ideas for growth</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: justify;">I believe that the avenues to learn and evolve is tremendous in the current environment and all of us need to embrace this opportunity and make a significant difference to our customers.</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Once again, I wish to thank you all for the tremendous difference you are making in the marketplace and wishing you and your family the very best.</p>
                
                <p>Regards</p>
